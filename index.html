    <h2>Arc Shot</h2>
    <p>
        The simple definition of an arc shot is a shot where the camera circles its subject.
        In an arc shot, the subject is typically still and the camera provides the motion,
        tracking around the subject in at least a semi-circle of movement.
        The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by
        photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer
        animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.

        Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images were recorded on a strip of chemically
        sensitized celluloid (photographic film stock), usually at the rate of 24 frames per second. The images are
        transmitted through a movie projector at the same rate as they were recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that
        each frame remains still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes stroboscopic intervals of
        darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions due to flicker fusion. The apparent motion on the
        screen is the result of the fact that the visual sense cannot discern the individual images at high speeds, so
        the impressions of the images blend with the interruptions and are thus linked together to produce the illusion
        of one moving image. An analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other
        sounds) runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and was not projected.

        Contemporary films are usually fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and
        exhibition.

        Film Definition
    </h2>
    <p>
        A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art used to simulate
        experiences
        that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images.
        These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word
        "cinema",
        short for cinematography,
        is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.
        The stroboscopic animation principle was introduced in 1833 with the stroboscopic disc (better known as the
        phénakisticope) and later applied in the zoetrope (since 1866), the flip book (since 1868), and the praxinoscope
        (since 1877), before it became the basic principle for cinematography.

        Experiments with early phénakisticope-based animation projectors were made at least as early as 1843 and
        publicly screened in 1847. Jules Duboscq marketed phénakisticope projection systems in France from circa 1853
        until the 1890s.

        Photography was introduced in 1839, but initially photographic emulsions needed such long exposures that the
        recording of moving subjects seemed impossible. At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed
        in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different
        viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial
        success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means
        to capture colour and motion. In 1849, Joseph Plateau published about the idea to combine his invention of the
        phénakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor Charles Wheatstone, and to use
        photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules
        Duboscq patented such an instrument as the "Stéréoscope-fantascope, ou Bïoscope", but he only marketed it very
        shortly, without succes. One Bïoscope disc with stereoscopic photographs of a machine is in the Plateau
        collection of the Ghent University, but no instruments or other discs have yet been found.
        <br>
        By the late 1850s the first examples of instantaneous photography came about and provided hope that motion
        photography would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method
        to record series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge eventually managed to take a
        series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the
        results as The Horse in Motion on cabinet cards. Muybridge, as well as Étienne-Jules Marey, Ottomar Anschütz and
        many others would create many more chronophotography studies. Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his
        chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his zoopraxiscope in his lectures from
        1880 to 1895. Anschütz developed his own Electrotachyscope in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images
        on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.

        Émile Reynaud already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images of the Praxinoscope in his 1877 patent
        application . He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the Société française de photographie on 4 June
        1880, but did not market his praxinoscope a projection before 1882. He then further developed the device into
        the Théâtre Optique which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created
        several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard
        frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a
        total of over 500,000 visitors at the Musée Grévin in Paris.
