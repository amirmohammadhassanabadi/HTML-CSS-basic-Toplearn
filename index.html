        Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] (audio speaker
        iconlisten)), is a German multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered
        in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The corporation was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it
        produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.
        Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the
        brand BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503
        vehicles produced.[3] The company has significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1,
        sports cars and the Isle of Man TT.
        BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the
        Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family is a long-term
        shareholder of the company (with the remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers Herbert and
        Harald Quandt's investments in 1959 which saved the company from bankruptcy.
        Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in Bavaria. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916
        into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922.
        However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name was founded by Karl Rapp
        (initially as Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH). The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were
        transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year.[4] BMW's first product was
        a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz.
        Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment,
        household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923.

        BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time,
        built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.[5] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi
        called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the
        1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.

        Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war,
        against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp,[citation needed] BMW concentrated on aircraft engine
        production using as many as 40,000 slave laborers.[6] These consisted primarily of prisoners from concentration
        camps, most prominently Dachau. Motorcycles remained as a side-line and automobile manufacture ceased
        altogether.

        BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from
        producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and
        bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the
        BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta
        microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in
        serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.

        A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate
        entity. The Quandt's father, Günther Quandt, was a well-known German industrialist. Quandt joined the Nazi party
        in 1933 and made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries.[7] Many of his
        enterprises were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his
        enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all.[8] One of his battery factories had
        its own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six months.[8] While
        Quandt and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by his father allowed
        Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[6]

        The BMW 700 was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.

        The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading
        manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury
        sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact
        sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupes in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978.

        The BMW M division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the BMW M5
        in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.

        The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large
        financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.

        In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.

        The 1995 BMW Z3 expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 BMW X5 was the
        company's entry into the SUV market.

        The first modern mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, (from 1973 to 1975, BMW built
        1672 units of a turbocharged M10 engine for the BMW 2002 turbo),[9] with most engines switching over to
        turbocharging over the 2010s. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW's first
        mass-production electric car was the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013, (from 1968 to 1972, BMW built
        two battery-electric BMW 1602 Elektro saloons for the 1972 Olympic Games).[10] After many years of establishing
        a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 BMW 2 Series
        Active Tourer multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

        In January 2021, BMW announced that its sales in 2020 fell by 8.4% due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
        and the restrictions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, BMW witnessed a rise of 3.2% of its customers'
        demands
        BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[33] Its motorcycle brand is
        now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in
        1923, though production originally began in 1921.[34] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder
        projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to
        the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are
        still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.

        The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

        During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a motor-driven sidecar attached, combined
        with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road.[35][36]

        In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a
        straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with
        single and parallel twin Rotax engines.

        In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead
        engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to
        1,170 cc (71 cu in) and enhanced performance to 75 kW (101 hp) for the R1200GS, compared to 63 kW (84 hp) of the
        previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S,
        producing 73 and 91 kW (98 and 122 hp), respectively.

        In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing
        125 kW (168 hp), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K
        models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork
        that BMW calls Duolever.

        BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of
        anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of
        electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

        BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before
        most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to
        1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging
        fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension
        design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under
        braking.

        BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna Motorcycles for an
        undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan
        Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

        In September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the
        technology to help improve road safety.[37] The design of the bike was inspired by the company's BMW R1200 GS
        model.
        BMW is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement
        Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[92] It is also a member
        of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[93]

        Since 1999, BMW has been named the world's most sustainable automotive company every year by the Dow Jones
        Sustainability Index.[94] The BMW Group is one of three automotive companies to be featured every year in the
        index.[95] In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global
        Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to
        appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[96] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable
        Development.[97]

        In 2012, BMW was the highest automotive company in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 list, with a score
        of 99 out of 100.[98][99] The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in
        2012.[100]

        To reduce vehicle emissions, BMW is improving the efficiency of existing fossil-fuel powered models, while
        researching electric power, hybrid power and hydrogen for future models.[101]

        During the first quarter of 2018, BMW sold 26,858 Electrified Vehicles (EVs, PHEVs, & Hybrids).
        DriveNow was a joint-venture between BMW and Sixt that operated from in Europe from 2011 until 2019. By December
        2012,[103] DriveNow operated over 1,000 vehicles, in five cities and with approximately 60,000 customers.[104]

        In 2012, the BMW-owned subsidiary Alphabet began a corporate car-sharing service in Europe called
        AlphaCity.[105][106]

        The ReachNow car-sharing service was launched in Seattle in April 2016.[107] ReachNow currently operates in
        Seattle, Portland and Brooklyn.

        In 2018, BMW announced the launching of a pilot car subscription service for the United States called Access by
        BMW (its first one for the country), in Nashville, Tennessee. In January 2021, the company said that Access by
        BMW was "suspended"
        BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[121] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn,
        near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the
        company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany.
        Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW
        retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

        Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local
        production of the 5 Series and 7 Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3 Series for the export
        market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New
        Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since
        1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and
        Iran, as well as South America.

        Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which
        used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the
        E30,[122] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.

        The plant code (position 11 in the VIN) for South African built models is "N"
